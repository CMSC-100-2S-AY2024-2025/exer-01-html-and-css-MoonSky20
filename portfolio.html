The objective is to transport as many passengers as possible to the Junction Unloading Area while avoiding natural and user-made disasters. 
                    The game features simultaneous player movements on a strategic map, with interactive elements such as randomly spawning power-ups that can alter the gameplay and provide tactical advantages. Players compete to achieve a specific victory condition, which involves controlling key areas of the map to gain an edge over their opponent.
